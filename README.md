# Visualizing Interesting Datasets

In this project, I will be performing a data visualization on two different datasets: 
* One in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format
* One in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format

Here is a link to the project instructions: [Project_02](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci040/tree/2022fall/project_02)

## China's GDP From 1960 to 2021
![](china_gdp_over_time.png)

The dataset used to create this line graph was downloaded from [awesome-json-datasets](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets#gdp). This JSON-formatted dataset contains statistics about China's gross domestic product (GDP) in billions of U.S. dollars from 1960 to 2021. Based on the line graph, we can see that China's GDP growth was stagnant in the 1960s, 1970s, and even in the 1980s. However, it really began to take off around the year 2000. In 2021, China's GDP amounted to nearly 18 trillion U.S. dollars. To grow from roughly 60 billion U.S. dollars (1960) to such a massive figure in a span of only 60 years is no short of an economic "miracle".

## Number of Titles (Movies and TV Shows) Available on Netflix by Release Year

The dataset used to create these two histograms was downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download). This CSV-formatted dataset contains statistics about the movies and TV shows available to watch on Netflix. In the graph above, the blue histogram represents the distribution of movie release years; the red histogram represents the distribution of TV show release years. Based on the graph, we can immediately recognize that Netflix has more movies than TV shows. In addition, we can also see that Netflix has a greater selection of older movies than it does older TV shows, with a few movies dating as far back as the mid-1900s.
